# 7 Pillars of AI Development
## White Paper

The design of principles we discuss rests on passionate engineering discipline leading us to a beautiful future.
Let's invent them.

- 1 – **KISS**. That's the first rule as it economizes our energy and allows us to grow an energy-efficient ecosystem. Don't overcomplicate. Keep the strongest reasons to empower the architecture. Adhere to minimalism.
- 2 – **No vendor lock**. Adapters should be part of the architecture, adhering to open standards — that's the way. If you do not center around a proprietary product as the key service provider of your solutions, then break the chains. Be adaptive.
- 3 – **Drill the low-level stuff**. Maintain the low level, the foundation. Don't let yourself become locked in trendy poor abstractions. Buy only what shines like a brilliant.
- 4 – **Respect open-source users and contributors**. If you claim your presence here as the author of an open-source repository, accept and follow the obligation to respond to any efforts with your involvement if you can, and ask to join maintainers among the other contributors if you can't. Uphold responsible ownership.
- 5 – **Remember, you do it open source on purpose.** Align your code to your non-material motivations. That helps to build your product's value.
- 6 – **Democratize Software Engineering.** Put effort into making your codebase accessible to a wider audience in the sense of inner work.
- 7 – **Don't do evil with AI.** Be responsible.
